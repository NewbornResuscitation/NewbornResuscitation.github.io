<p> <b> Phase Change Material Instructions  </b> </p>
 	<p> The purpose of the Phase Change Material (PCM) is to keep the baby warm during resuscitation. This is important because we want to avoid the risk of hypothermia. Here are instructions on how to set up and use the PCM: </p>

   <p> <ol>
   <li> Activate the PCM by pushing on the small button indicated on the package with a red dot. </li>
   <li> Wait for PCM to quickly warm up. </li>
   <li> Touch PCM with your bare hands to make sure it is not too hot. We want to make sure it will not burn the babyâ€™s skin. </li>
   <li> Place PCM on surface, and then place baby on top of the PCM. </li> 
   <li> Keep baby on PCM while performing the resuscitating
