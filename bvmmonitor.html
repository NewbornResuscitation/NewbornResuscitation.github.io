<p> <b> Bag Valve Mask Monitor Instructions  </b> </p>
 	 <p>Monitor of BVM is connected to the device and will provide feedback as to whether resuscitation is adequate for the infant.</p> 
  
        <p>Monitor will measure if proper breaths are being given and will provide frequency of breaths.</p>
  
        <p>It will provide light indication that informs you when you should provide breath by lighting up. It will also measure the pressure inside the mask to ensure you are administering enough oxygen to the infant per squeeze of the BVM.</p>
        
        <p>Red light means ventilation doesnâ€™t deliver enough oxygen, green light means pressure and ventilation are proper.</p>
  
        <p>Pay attention to the monitor while performing resuscitation. It will accurately measure if you need to adjust your resuscitation technique.</p>
