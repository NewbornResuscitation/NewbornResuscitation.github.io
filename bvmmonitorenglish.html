<p> <b> Bag-Valve-Mask Monitor Instructions  </b> </p>
 	 <p>Monitor of BVM is connected to the device and will provide feedback as to whether resuscitation is adequate for the infant.</p> 
  
        <p>Monitor will measure if proper breaths are being given and will provide frequency of breaths.</p>
 
        <p>Pay attention to the monitor while performing resuscitation. It will accurately measure if you need to adjust your resuscitation technique.</p>
  
        <p>It will provide light indication that informs you when you should provide breath by lighting up. It will also measure the pressure inside the mask to ensure you are administering enough oxygen to the infant per squeeze of the BVM.</p>
 
 <p><b> How to Interpret Light Indications </b></p>
        
        <p>Red light means ventilation doesn’t deliver enough oxygen, green light means pressure and ventilation are proper.</p>
  
 
 <p> <b> Bag-valve-mask ventilation </b> </p>
        <p> Place the mask on top of the baby's nose and mouth, as seen in the image below. Press the mask properly so that no air leaks. Use one hand to hold the mask, placing the thumb on one side and the index and middle fingers on the other side. Use the other hand to then squeeze the bag at a rate of 30 to 60 breaths per minute for one minute. If the baby's chest rises and falls, then the ventilation was successful. </p>
        
        <p> Warning: do not allow excessive ventilation pressure, this will cause pneumothorax (air will leak into the baby's lungs). </p>
        
        <p> If the baby's chest does not rise and fall after ventilation: </p>
  
        <ul>
         
        <li> Make sure bag and mask are connected properly. </li>
         
        <li> Make sure the mask is placed at the correct position on the face.</li>
         
        <li> Make sure the baby's head position is correct. </li>
